<!-- Short description: -->
  <h3>Example of class declaration in Emacs:</h3>
  <h4>Class for cars that has slots: name, manufacturer, date of manufacturing, and mileage. 
  Of those slots only the mileage will be writable.
  The class has methods that create a clone of the class, which creates the object and tells the age of the car. </h4>
</div>

## How to use

Declare the class and methods in Emacs and create the object:

```magik
 (user)MagikSF> car1 << cars_example.new( "car1", "Toyota", date.from_ymd(2020,20,11))
 (user)MagikSF> car1.name
"car1"
 ```
