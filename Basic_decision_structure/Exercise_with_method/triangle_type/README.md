  <h3>Make a Method to identify the type of triangle by the size of the sides and show the result in Emacs</h3>

</div>

## How to use

Declare the method in Emacs and call it by .triangle_type() in a second command

```magik
 (user)MagikSF> a << 10.0
 (user)MagikSf> a.triangle_type()
"The triangle is Isosceles"
 ```
